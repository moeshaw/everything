title:  "OOP (Course 2): Services, Dependency Injection and Containers"
summary: |
    Time to take things up a notch!
    
    In this Course, we'll leverage what we learned in
    [Course 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo) to *really* start
    using what we know. We'll clean up old functions with new classes, learn
    a practice called dependency injection and organize our objects into
    something called a container. This is the course that *really* makes
    objects useful and sets us up for future stuff (inheritance, interfaces, etc).
    
    So let's get serious:
    
    * Service Classes
    * Organize with private functions
    * Goodbye arrays, hello BattleResult
    * Objects passed by Reference
    * Query from the Database, but using Objects!
    * Dependency Injection!!!
    * Creating a Service Container
    
    Do it!
