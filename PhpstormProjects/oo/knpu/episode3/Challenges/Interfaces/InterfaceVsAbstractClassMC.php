You over-hear the intern Bob telling another teammate about the differences between
abstract classes and interfaces. He's *mostly* right, but he got one detail wrong.
Which of the following is *not* true:

`C` is the only answer that's incorrect: both interfaces and abstract classes can
force you to implement methods in the classes that use them. So in many ways, they
are the same.

So why use one or the other? Well, a class can implement *many* interfaces, which
makes interfaces more attractive, especially for re-usable code. But, an abstract
class can contain *real* methods, which can help you reduce code duplication between
classes. They're similar, but not the same.
