In the previous challenge, you split the logic from `StringTransformer`
into two different classes. What are the advantages of this?

All of these are advantages! Before, you might not even realize that
the `StringTransformer` had caching logic, but now its very obvious:
the caching logic is in a class called `Cache` and you can see that
the `StringTransformer` requires a `Cache` object. You could also use
the `Cache` class in other situations to cache other things. And you
could even - with a little bit of work - create a new `Cache` class
that caches via something like Redis, and pass *this* to `StringTransformer`
to cache using a different method.
