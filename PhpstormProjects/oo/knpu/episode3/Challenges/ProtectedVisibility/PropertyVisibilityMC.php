Check out the following code:

```php
// Ship.php

class Ship
{
    public \$name;

    protected \$weaponPower;

    private \$defense;

    public function getDefense()
    {
        return \$this->defense;
    }
}
```

```php
// JediShip.php

class JediShip extends Ship
{
    public function getWeaponPower()
    {
        return \$this->weaponPower;
    }
}
```

```php
// index.php

\$jediShip = new JediShip();
\$jediShip->name;
\$jediShip->weaponPower;
```

Which of the above code will give us an error?

Since the `\$defense` property is `private`, we can only access it from
within the `Ship` class. But that's exactly what we're doing in (B),
so that's fine.

The `\$weaponPower` property is `protected`. That means we can access it
only from inside `Ship`, `JediShip` or any other sub-classes. That's why
(C) is valid. But in (A), we're accessing `weaponPower` from `index.php`.
Accessing a property or method from outside of the class is only allowed
if it is public. This is a bad code.
